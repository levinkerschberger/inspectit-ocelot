# inspectIT Ocelot - Configuration Server

This project contains the Ocelot configuration server.
It's a standalone component based on Spring Boot.
It can be build by `gradle bootJar` and started by `java -jar inspectit-ocelot-configurationserver-X.X.X.jar` or directly via gradle `gradle bootRun`.

To use a custom logback configuration, you have to start the Configuration Server like this: `java -Dlogging.config=<PATH_TO_YOUR_LOGBACK_CONFIG> -jar inspectit-ocelot-configurationserver-X.X.X.jar`
_Please note that Spring Boot ignores the default `-Dlogback.configurationFile` property!_

If you have trouble to execute the gradle tasks, which include the tasks from the 'inspectit-ocelot-configurationserver-ui' module, then try to use your local yarn installation.
Go to components/inspectit-ocelot-configurationserver-ui/build.gradle and change the following line:
```groovy
download = true
```
to
```groovy
download = false
```

It is used to manage and store agent configurations.
The configurations can be fetched by Ocelot agents via a REST interface.
By default, the REST interface is exposed on port 8090.

The application is using Swagger for API documentation and is also providing a Swagger UI.
By default, the Swagger UI is available at: http://\<HOST\>:\<PORT\>/swagger-ui.html
